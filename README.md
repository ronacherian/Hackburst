# Hackburst
This is an iOS Application to navigate inside a building.</br>
As GPS does not work inside a building, we tried using Gyroscope and the Accelerometer. 

Though the full implementation was not successful, I hope this might help fellow people to give an idea of how to develop an indoor navigation applicaiton.</br>

<h2>Problems Encountered:</h2>
The response from Gyroscope and Accelerometer was slow, usually delayed by 30s and was not able to track the instataneous positions of the user.

<h2>Lesson Learned:</h2>
External sensors are required to implement it successfully. Any suggestions are welcomed!
